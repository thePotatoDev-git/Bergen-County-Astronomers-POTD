## How It's Made:

**Tech Used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIs

For this project, I used NASA's API to grab a picture that was featured by NASA on any specific date.

## Lessons Learned:

I have just been introduced to APIs and I learned how useful and robust APIs can be for your apps. I made a simple design using HTML and CSS and implemented NASA's API to create this small Picture of the Day app.
