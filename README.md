# Bergen County Astronomers Picture of the Day
A small API project for the Bergen County Astronomers Club that shows the picture of the day using NASA's API. Simply enter a date, and it will populate the page with a picture and description.

## How It's Made:

**Tech Used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIs

For this project, I used NASA's API to grab a picture that was featured by NASA on any specific date.

## Lessons Learned:

I have just been introduced to APIs and I learned how useful and robust APIs can be for your apps. I made a simple design using HTML and CSS and implemented NASA's API to create this small Picture of the Day app.
